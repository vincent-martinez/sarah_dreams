# Small game demo (horizontal shmup)

- Old small project from 2017 (code can definitely be improved).
- The idea of the game came when I was watching my daughter sleep and she had a fighting pose so I was imagining her fighting in her dreams.
- Player and most enemies sprites drawn by my wife.

Code based on below tutorial:
